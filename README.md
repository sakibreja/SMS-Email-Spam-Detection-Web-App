# SMS-Email-Spam-Detection-Web-App
Role: Data Scientist & NLP Engineer
Purpose: Built a machine learning-powered web application to classify SMS and email messages as spam or not spam, enhancing security and filtering efficiency.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, TF-IDF Vectorization, Pickle
Key Contributions:
•	Developed a text preprocessing pipeline using NLTK, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
•	Trained a machine learning model using TF-IDF vectorization and classification algorithms to detect spam messages.
•	Created a Streamlit-based interactive web app for real-time message classification.
•	Deployed the model using Pickle for efficient prediction and user-friendly interaction.
Impact: Improved email and SMS filtering by enabling automated spam detection, reducing unwanted messages, and enhancing user security.
